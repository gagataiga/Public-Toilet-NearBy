## Description
Public-Toilet-Nearby is a service that allows you to find nearby public toilets, regardless of whether they are free or paid. You can choose a toilet you want to visit from your current location and even get directions, ensuring you can easily find a restroom without getting lost.

<br/>
"This app has been deployed, but I'm currently considering where to deploy it, especially since it's taking a long time to render.ã€€Also, due to the low number of posts, toilets may not actually be displayed in your area."

<br/>

## Why do I want to create this app?

The purpose behind creating this service stems from my personal experiences during my time living abroad. I found it incredibly challenging to locate restrooms, and I often felt the lack of services helping me find available restroom facilities.
