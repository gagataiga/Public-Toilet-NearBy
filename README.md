## Description

Public-Toilet-Nearby is a service that allows you to find nearby public toilets,regardless of whether they are free or paid. You can choose a toilet you want to visit from your current location and even get directions, ensuring you can easily find a restroom without getting lost.

<br/>

## Why I wanted to create this app?

The purpose behind creating this service stems from my personal experiences during my time living abroad. I found it incredibly challenging to locate restrooms, and I often felt the lack of services helping me find available restroom facilities.
